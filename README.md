# ROV25-Photogrammetry

Welcome: This is the repository for a WIP system that runs photogrammetry while the ROV is being driven. It contains code for taking a video of the ROV's feed using QGroundControl, and then taking JPEG images from an MP4 and inserting them into PTGUI, the ROV's selected photogrammetry software.

## Workflow

This repository has three branches. The Main is for the current build of the software, while the other two are for testing our new ideas for efficiency.
