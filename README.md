# ROV25-Photogrammetry

Welcome: This is the repository for a WIP system that runs photogrammetry while the ROV is being driven. It contains code for taking JPEG images from a MP4 and inserting them into PTGUI, the ROV's selected photogrammetry software.

## Workflow

This repository is stupid mainly because the software really isn't that complicated and doesn't need optimization. I'll probably work on making it more optimized when I'm not stupid.
