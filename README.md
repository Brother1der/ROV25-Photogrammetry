# ROV25-Photogrammetry

Welcome: This is the repository for a WIP system that runs photogrammetry while the ROV is being driven. It contains code for taking JPEG images from a MP4 and inserting them into PTGUI, the ROV's selected photogrammetry software.

## Workflow

This repository is only one branch, mainly because the software really isn't that complicated. I'll probably work on organizing it for later if it becomes more complicated. Things may get a little wonky though.
