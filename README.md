#ROV25-Photogrammetry

Welcome: This is the repository for a WIP system to run photogrammetry while the ROV is being driven. It contains code for the process of taking JPEG images from a camera, and inserting them into PTGUI, the selected photogrammetry software for the ROV.

##Workflow

This repository is only one branch, mainly because the software really isn't that complicated. I'll probably work on organizing it for later if it becomes more complicated. Things may get a little wonky though.
